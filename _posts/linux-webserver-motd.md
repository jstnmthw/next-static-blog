Have you ever logged into your Linux server and wished for a more informative and stylish welcome message? The Message of the Day (MOTD) is the first thing you see when connecting to your server via SSH, and with a few simple steps, you can customize it to display essential system information in a visually appealing manner.

## Remove existing motd's (optional)

Remove execution of the existing update-motd sections, leaving required updates and system reboot.

```sh
sudo chmod -x /etc/update-motd.d/*
sudo rm /etc/update-motd.d/*landscape*
sudo chmod +x /etc/update-motd.d/*updates-available
sudo chmod +x /etc/update-motd.d/*reboot-required
```

The existing motd file is usually located in `/etc/motd`. You can empty this motd if you only want the new customized motd:

```sh
> /etc/motd
```

## Download &amp; install motd

You can view the script [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jstnmthw/webserver-spot-instance/master/motd.sh), which is a part of a repo that can be used as AWS Spot Instance linux web server.

```sh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jstnmthw/webserver-spot-instance/master/motd.sh > /tmp/motd.sh
chmod +x /tmp/motd.sh
sudo mv /tmp/motd.sh /etc/update-motd.d/00-motd
```
